<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>establishing an Egyptian colony</h2>
<p>
Napoleon's Campaign in Egypt, which took place between 1798 and 1801, was a French expedition with the aim of establishing a colony in Egypt and threatening British possessions in India.
</p>
<p>
Despite initial victories, the campaign ultimately ended in failure. The expedition is notable for the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and the birth of modern Egyptology.

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="card">
<p>
The French army, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte, was initially successful. After a brief stop at Malta, where they captured the island, the French reached Alexandria and captured the city. They then marched on to Cairo, defeating a Mamluk army along the way at the Battle of the Pyramids. However, the French suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of the Nile, which took place on 1 August 1798. In this battle, the French fleet was almost completely destroyed by the British Navy, led by Admiral Horatio Nelson. This defeat cut off the French army from any supplies or reinforcements from France.
</p>
<p>
Despite these obstacles, Napoleon attempted to win the sympathy of the Egyptian population by theological discussions with local sheikhs and by presenting himself as a liberator. He financed the three-day celebration of the birthday of the prophet Muhammad and established the Institut d'Egypte. Despite his efforts, the campaign ultimately ended in failure. Napoleon returned to France in 1799, leaving General Jean-Baptiste Kléber in command of the French forces.

<h2>The Third Coalition 1805</h2>
<p>
Napoleon Bonaparte devised a massive plan to invade the British Isles, assembling 180,000 soldiers at Boulogne. To achieve this, he attempted to gain naval superiority, but his plans proved unsuccessful.

The Franco-Spanish fleet led by Admiral Villeneuve was defeated at the Battle of Trafalgar by Horatio Nelson, the latter losing his life in the battle. Napoleon then abandoned his plan to invade Britain and turned his attention to his enemies on the continent.

The naval and colonial conflict that preceded these events influenced Napoleon's decision to abandon the invasion of Great Britain. The conflict in the Caribbean and the occupation of colonial bases had a direct impact on the European conflicts.
</p>
<p>
As Austria joined the coalition against France, Napoleon had to deal with an Austrian army of about 70,000 men. During the Ulm Campaign, he succeeded in encircling and forcing the surrender of the Austrian army led by Karl Mack von Leiberich.

He then occupied Vienna and faced a numerically superior Russo-Austrian army. December 1805 brought Napoleon a decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, after which Austria signed the Treaty of Pressburg, ceding Venetia and Tyrol. With Austria's withdrawal from the coalition, Napoleon became dominant on the continent, although the Russian army had not yet fully entered the conflict.

<h2>Fourth Coalition 1806–1807</h2>
<p>
The Fourth Coalition, formed in 1806–1807, was an attempt to oppose Napoleon's expansion and French power. It included Prussia, the Russian Empire, Saxony, Sweden, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The coalition was formed quickly after the collapse of the Third Coalition. In July 1806, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, transforming several German states into duchies and kingdoms under French influence, thus facilitating the rule of non-Prussian Germany. In August, the King of Prussia decided to enter the war independently of the other great powers. In September, Napoleon attacked the Prussian forces, winning decisive victories at the Battles of Jena and Auerstädt. Berlin was captured in record time, and Napoleon issued decrees that laid the foundation for the Continental System, a trade blockade against the United Kingdom.

</p>
<p>
With the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Tsar Alexander I was forced to make peace with Napoleon, and Russia became a temporary ally of France. Napoleon then focused on driving Russian forces out of Poland and creating the Duchy of Warsaw. In the Battles of Eylau and Friedland, the Russian armies were defeated, and the Tsar was forced to sign the Treaty of Tilsit. At the Congress of Erfurt, Napoleon and Alexander agreed to force Sweden to join the Continental System, triggering the Finnish War of 1808–1809 and dividing Sweden in two. The Coalition thus had a significant impact on European politics and events of the period, marking a crucial moment in the confrontation with Napoleon's expansion.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the coup of 18 Brumaire was a turning point in French history, marking the end of the French Revolution and the beginning of a new period of political stability and military dominance.

<h2>The Fifth Coalition 1809</h2>
<p>
The Fifth Coalition, formed in 1809, was an attempt by the United Kingdom and the Austrian Empire to oppose Napoleon's expansion and French power. However, the United Kingdom remained largely alone in the fight, relying more on its seas than its land forces. The Royal Navy became a formidable force, winning successive naval battles and blockaded French ports. In terms of land operations, the coalition had few notable successes. The British attempt at Walcheren in 1809 ended in disaster, and British land operations were limited to rapid attacks, supported by the Royal Navy. In the Iberian Peninsula, the conflict began when Portugal resumed trade with the United Kingdom, causing the alliance with France to break. French troops gradually occupied Spain, and British intervention soon followed. In the east, Austria attempted to regain lost territory in Germany, but Napoleon was able to organize his forces and win decisive victories at the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram.

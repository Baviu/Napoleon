    <h1 class="main-title">War of the First Coalition</h1>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>Conflict context</h2>
<p>
The War of the First Coalition was a conflict between the French First Republic and several European powers between 1792 and 1797.
Although the European powers were collectively superior to France, they were not always coordinated in their actions.
</p>
<p>
The war began with France's declaration of war against the Habsburg Monarchy in April 1792.
In July of that year, a Prussian army entered France, but was defeated at the Battle of Valmy.
</p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>The First Stage of the War</h2>
<p>
In the early months of the war, the French army was poorly organized, and its commanders were inexperienced in large-scale European warfare.
However, the enthusiasm and rapid mobilization of the population, through a measure called the <strong>levée en masse</strong>, compensated for the lack of military training.
</p>
<p>
The Battle of Valmy, fought on September 20, 1792, marked the first major French victory against the coalition formed by Prussia and Austria.
This victory strengthened the Republic and demonstrated that the French army could defeat more experienced powers.
</p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>Later campaigns</h2>
<p>
After Valmy, the French launched counteroffensives in the Rhine region and northern Italy.
French troops captured strategic territory, and the military success was used to expand the Republic's political and economic influence.
</p>
<p>
Austria was forced to cede the Austrian Netherlands and other territories by the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).
This was a major diplomatic and military victory, which established France as the dominant European power.
</p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>Impact on Europe</h2>
<p>
The War of the First Coalition changed the balance of power in Europe. Traditional monarchies began to fear the expansion of revolutionary ideas.
France's influence expanded not only militarily, but also culturally and politically, promoting the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
</p>
<p>
Military conflicts also stimulated reforms in the armies of other states, which had to modernize their structure and tactics to meet new challenges.
</p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>The Role of Napoleon</h2>
<p>
During this period, Napoleon Bonaparte began his rise within the French army.
His tactical and strategic contributions were recognized by his superiors, and his success in various missions attracted political attention.
</p>
<p>
His pro-republican pamphlet <em>"Le Souper de Beaucaire"</em> demonstrated his ability to combine political influence with military strategy,
preparing him for a decisive role in France's future campaigns.

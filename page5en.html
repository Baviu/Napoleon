<!-- SECTION 1 -->

<h2>18 Brumaire</h2>
<p>
The coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (Jacobin-imposed calendar - November 9–10, 1799), was a bloodless coup d'état that overthrew the French Directory and brought Napoleon Bonaparte to power as First Consul of France.
</p>
<p>
The coup was led by Napoleon, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, and Roger Ducos, who were members of the Directory.

The conspirators took advantage of the growing restlessness and fatigue of the French people, who had become tired of the political instability and constant state of war in which the country found itself. The coup d'état was carried out in a series of carefully calculated moves.

The Directory was weakened by the resignation of three of its five members, making it difficult for the government to function. At the same time, Napoleon and his allies spread false rumors of an imminent Jacobin uprising in Paris, causing the Council of Ancients and the Council of Five Hundred (the two legislative bodies of the Directory) to flee to the safety of the Château de Saint-Cloud, located outside the city. </p>

<p>
Napoleon was then placed in charge of securing the Councils and given command of local troops, which he used to intimidate and control the members of the Councils. The coup was completed when the Councils passed a decree dissolving the existing government and appointing the three conspirators as provisional consuls. The lack of popular resistance to the coup signaled the end of the French Revolution and paved the way for Napoleon's subsequent rise to power.

</p>
<p>
Overall, the coup of 18 Brumaire was a turning point in French history, marking the end of the French Revolution and the beginning of a new period of political stability and military dominance.

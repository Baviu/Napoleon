<h1 class="main-title">The Russian Campaign of 1812</h1>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="card">
<p>
In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte, the renowned military leader and conqueror, embarked on a campaign in Russia that would prove to be one of the most catastrophic defeats in his history.

Although he had the largest European army ever assembled, with over 600,000 soldiers, his training was inadequate for Russian conditions. During the campaign, the French army faced multiple challenges. The Russian scorched earth strategy, in which their own territories were burned and abandoned, created major difficulties in supplying Napoleon's army. In addition, winter arrived much earlier than expected, and the French army was unprepared for the extreme temperatures and lack of proper equipment for the weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
Although there were some initial successes, including the capture of Moscow, Napoleon and his army were forced to retreat in the face of Russian resistance and harsh conditions. The retreat was marked by constant attacks from the Russian army and the harsh winter conditions, which led to massive loss of life and the disorganization of the French army. The return to France was a moment of humiliation for Napoleon, who lost his reputation for invincibility and suffered a decisive defeat. The Russian campaign marked the beginning of the end for Napoleon and his Empire, emphasizing the importance of proper preparation and understanding the conditions of battle in any military conflict.</p>

<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p>
Born in Corsica in 1769, <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte</strong> came from a family of Italian nobility. His father, Carlo Buonaparte, was a lawyer who was appointed as Corsica's representative at the court of Louis XVI, while his mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino, was known for her firm discipline.        </p>

<h2>Napoleon's Academic Background</h2>
<p>
Napoleon was baptized a Catholic and began his education at a theological school, to learn French.
In May 1779, he was admitted to the Military Academy at Brienne-le-Château, where he particularly excelled in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
In 1784, he was admitted to the prestigious <strong>École Militaire de Paris</strong>, which he graduated in just one year,
due to intense effort and the difficult family situation after the death of his father. At the age of only 16, he became
a second lieutenant in artillery.
</p>

<p>
During the French Revolution, Napoleon returned to Corsica, where he supported the Jacobin faction.
He participated in local political and military conflicts, and his pro-republican pamphlet,
<em>"Le Souper de Beaucaire"</em>, brought him acclaim and promotion to brigadier general
after his success at the Siege of Toulon.

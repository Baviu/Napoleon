<h1 class="main-title">Sixth Coalition</h1>

<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section class="card">

<p>
<h2>Alliance</h2>
The Sixth Coalition was a military alliance against Napoleon's French Empire, consisting of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and several German states. This coalition was formed in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and succeeded in defeating Napoleon and driving him into exile. The formation of the Sixth Coalition was prompted by Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. After suffering heavy losses, Napoleon's army was forced to retreat, and many of his allies began to consider rebellion. The Convention of Tauroggen, signed in December 1812, marked a significant turning point when Prussian General Yorck von Wartenburg declared neutrality and refused to continue supporting Napoleon's army. In February 1813, Austria ended its alliance with France and switched to a position of armed neutrality. Meanwhile, Sweden entered into a military alliance with the United Kingdom and declared war on France. Prussia followed suit and declared war on France in March 1813, and the first armed conflict between the Coalition and France took place on 5 April.

<h2>Successes</h2>
<p>
The Sixth Coalition was able to take advantage of Napoleon's weakened position in the Peninsular War, where he had withdrawn troops to reinforce his forces in Central Europe. Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese forces took advantage of this weakness and by June 1813 had decisively defeated Napoleon's forces in Spain. The final victory of the Sixth Coalition came at the Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of the Nations, in October 1813. This battle was the largest in European history before World War I and marked the beginning of the end for Napoleon's empire. The Allies continued to advance into France, eventually occupying Paris and forcing Napoleon to abdicate. In conclusion, the Sixth Coalition was a significant military alliance that succeeded in defeating Napoleon and ending his empire. The coalition's success was due to a combination of Napoleon's weakened position, the defection of several allies, and the strategic and military skill of the Coalition leaders.</p>
